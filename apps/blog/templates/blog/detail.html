            <p>These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is
                untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be
                welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the
                obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances
                accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection. But I
                must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I
                will give you a complete account of the system.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.”</p>
                <span>Oscar Wilde</span>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain,
                but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.

            <ul>

                and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes
